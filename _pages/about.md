## Causal Inference and Machine Learning Book

I am currently working on a [ Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown]), where we can see tutorials using R and Python. The main topics this book covers are: 

* Prediction/Inference with High Dimensional Linear Models
* Prediction in Modern Nonlinear Regressions (Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks)
* Randomized Control Trials
* Causal DAGs
* Double/debiased Machine Learning
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Trees
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Forest
* Feature Engineering With Deep Learning for Causal and Predictive Inference
